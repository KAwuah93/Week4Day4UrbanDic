# Week4 Weekend:

### Description:
  - In this assignment we were tasked to create a simple API call with an attached header to a database for Urban dictionary. We created an API call that pulls a list of terms as well as a few other fields and parsed it into objects. We fed that objects into an array listm which was then passed into a custom array adapter for the Recycler View. We used Retrofit for the HTTP call and RXjava for the threading scheme.
